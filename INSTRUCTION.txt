This application consists of two main servers: 
    1. Bootstrap server
    2. Node servers

--- BOOTSTRAP SERVER ---

In order to run bootstrap server relevant .java files are to be compliled from ./Server/src
Needed commands to execute are noted in 'server.sh'. It's easier to just run this script in Linux terminal.
        
    _Script Code_
        javac Server/src/Neighbour.java  Server/src/BootstrapServer.java -d Server
        cd Server && java BootstrapServer


--- NODE SERVERS ---

Relevant files to be compiled are stored in ./Node/src
Needed commands are in 'one_node.sh' for easy execution in Linux terminal.

    _Script Code_
        javac Node/src/Neighbour.java Node/src/Node.java -d Node
        cd Node && java Node





*** However for the ease of modeling multiple nodes there's 'node.sh' script.
    This will boot up 5 Node servers for testing purpose
    (However it should be noted that 'xterm' used here and might not be functioning in all terminals.)
